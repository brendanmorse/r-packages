Description: This package calculates basic descriptive statistics including
    mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum/
    maximum values, and potential outliers based on the median absolute deviation.
    Users are also allowed to specify whether the data represents a sample or a
    population which affects the calculation of the variance and standard deviation
    (sample uses n-1 denominator). Finally, a histogram plotting option is built in
    using ggplot2.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.2),
    ggplot2,
