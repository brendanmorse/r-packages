Description: This package contains two functions. The ‘descriptives’ function
    calculates basic descriptive statistics including mean, median, mode, variance,
    standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum/maximum values, and potential
    outliers based on the median absolute deviation. Users are also allowed to
    specify whether the data represents a sample or a population which affects
    the calculation of the variance and standard deviation (sample uses n-1
    denominator). Finally, a histogram plotting option is built in using ggplot2.
    The ’summarySE’ function summarizes a measured variable by a grouping variable
    and calculates the standard error and desired confidence interval. Useful for
    plotting group comparisons with standard error bars.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.2),
